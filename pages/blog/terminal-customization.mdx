- ZSH: a robust alternative to traditional `BASH`
- ohmyzsh: an amazing framework for `ZSH` with many plugins and themes
- zsh-autosuggestions: an advanced plugin that makes command completion suggestions based on previous commands.

## Step 1:

The first thing to do is to install `ZSH`. This is default on macOS now, and the shell is located at `/bin/zsh`. If you're using Linux, however, you'll need to install it through the package manager and run the command:

```bash
zsh
```

in order to go through the first time user setup. Now that ZSH is installed, we have to set it as the default. To do this, run:

```bash
chsh -s /path/to/zsh
```

with `/path/to/zsh` being either `/usr/bin/zsh` or `/bin/zsh` depending on your system.

  return <ArticleLayout meta={meta}>{children}</ArticleLayout>;
};
