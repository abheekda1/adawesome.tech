Recently, I had to make a project where people learn concepts from AP Computer Science by doing--meaning I had to create a sort of template project in Java that could be filled in by someone else to learn past concepts as a review. As brainfuck is already something I'm familiar, I thought there could be nothing better than to write another interpreter, albeit a slightly faster one.

## Approach
As I said in the other article about brainfuck, the spec is along the lines of this:  

`>`: move the pointer to the next cell  
`<`: move the pointer to the previous cell  
`+`: increment the data in the current cell  
`-`: decrement the data in the current cell  
`.`: output the ASCII character at the current cell  
`,`: get a single character input and store it in the current cell  
`[`: run normally unless the current cell is at 0, in which case jump past the matching `]`  
`]`: go back to the matching `[` if the current cell is not 0  

Unlike last time, I wanted to first make some things more efficient, so I decided to use hash maps to match brackets together instead of iterating every time. This way, if I was on one bracket I could jump to the other easily and I was able to fill the hash maps (one for open to close brackets and one the other way around) once in the beginning.

Filling them looked something like this:
```java filename="Interpreter.java"
public class Interpreter {
...
  private HashMap<Integer, Integer> openToClose = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
  private HashMap<Integer, Integer> closeToOpen = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();

  private void fillBracketMaps() {
      for (int i = 0; i < parser.getSourceStripped().length(); i++) {
          if (parser.getSourceStripped().charAt(i) == '[') {
              char closeBracket = '[';
              int depth = 0;
              int j = i;
              while (closeBracket != ']' || depth >= 0) {
                  j++;
                  String strippedSource = parser.getSourceStripped();
                  closeBracket = strippedSource.charAt(j);
                  if (closeBracket == '[')
                      depth++;
                  else if (closeBracket == ']')
                      depth--;
              }
              openToClose.put(i, j);
              closeToOpen.put(j, i);
          }
      }
  }
...
}
```

Outside of this concept however, I decided to at least try to stay at least somewhat in touch with interpreter/compiler file structures, meaning I have to start with the lexer and the parser.


## Implementation
I decided to jump straight into the parser since the lexer could just run character by character. I first created an enum to keep track of the different commands:
```java filename="Parser.java"
public class Parser {
...
  // an enum is just a way to have a defined set of possible values
  public enum Command {
      POINTER_RIGHT,
      POINTER_LEFT,
      INC_CELL,
      DEC_CELL,
      OUTPUT,
      INPUT,
      OPEN_BRACKET,
      CLOSE_BRACKET,
      EOF
  }
...
}
```
I then decided to give the class three properties: the source (of course!), the stripped source storing just the commands and nothing extra, and a "pointer" (index) of the current character in the stripped source while iterating through it.
```java filename="Parser.java"
private String source = "";
private String sourceStripped = "";
private int tokenPointer = 0;
...
private void stripSource() {
    for (char c : source.toCharArray()) {
        if (new String("><+-.,[]").indexOf(c) != -1)
            sourceStripped += c;
    }
}
```
I then made a function called `getNextToken` which takes no parameters and just returns whatever command the current character represents from the enum. Here's what the template looks like for other students following the activity:
```java filename="Parser.java"
public Command getNextToken() {
    // return EOF if it's past the last token:

    // create a ret var of type Command:

    switch (sourceStripped.charAt(tokenPointer)) {
        case '>':
            ret = Command.POINTER_RIGHT;
            break;
        case '<':
            ret = Command.POINTER_LEFT;
            break;
        case '+':
            ret = Command.INC_CELL;
            break;
        case '-':
            ret = Command.DEC_CELL;
            break;
        case '.':
            ret = Command.OUTPUT;
            break;
        case ',':
            ret = Command.INPUT;
            break;
        case '[':
            ret = Command.OPEN_BRACKET;
            break;
        case ']':
            ret = Command.CLOSE_BRACKET;
            break;
    }

    // increment the tokenPointer to move to the next token when the function is
    // called again

    return ret;
}
```
That's the end of the functions for the parser, now it's time for the interpreter.

The `Interpreter` class had the memory cells (just an array of 30,000 `int`s), a pointer (current index in cells), a parser object to... parse, and the hash maps mentioned above.

It also had just one public function `run` which looped through all commands using `getNextCommand` from the parser until it hit the `EOF`. For each token, it ran the `handleCommand` function which took in a command for the current command and the index of said command since `getNextToken` increments the index and I didn't want to use `parser.getTokenIdx() - 1` for clarity. Here's what the template functions look like:
```java filename="Interpreter.java"
// main loop function
public void run() {
    // write code here to loop through all parser tokens until EOF
    // calling the `handleCommand` function to determine what to do depending on
    // the token type

}

// this function takes the command and the current character index in case
// you would like to use it
private void handleCommand(Parser.Command command, int idx) {
    switch (command) {
        case POINTER_RIGHT:
            // code goes here
            break;
        case POINTER_LEFT:
            // code goes here
            break;
        case INC_CELL:
            // code goes here
            break;
        case DEC_CELL:
            // code goes here
            break;
        case INPUT:
            // code goes here
            break;
        case OUTPUT:
            // code goes here
            break;
        case OPEN_BRACKET:
            // code goes here
            break;
        case CLOSE_BRACKET:
            // code goes here
            break;
        case EOF: // never happens
    }
}
```

From there, one only has to create a `main` function and initialize an interpreter with some source, and then use the `run` method. Example:
```java filename="App.java"
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Interpreter interpreter = new Interpreter(Files.readString(Paths.get("input")));
        interpreter.run();
    }
}

```

I also created tests along the way so students could easily check their progress with VS Code's integrated test runner. Here's an example of one of those tests:
```java filename="ParserTest.java"
public class ParserTest {
...
  @Test
  public void strip() {
      Parser parser = new Parser(
              "1 +++++ +++               Set Cell #0 to 8\n" +
                      "2 [\n" +
                      "3     >++++               Add 4 to Cell #1; this will always set Cell #1 to 4\n" +
                      "4     [                   as the cell will be cleared by the loop\n" +
                      "5         >++             Add 4*2 to Cell #2\n" +
                      "6         >+++            Add 4*3 to Cell #3\n" +
                      "7         >+++            Add 4*3 to Cell #4\n" +
                      "8         >+              Add 4 to Cell #5\n");
      assertTrue(parser.getSourceStripped().equals("++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+"));
  }
...
}
```

Finally, I gave students instructions in the README and added a [solution branch](https://github.com/abheekda1/apcs-semester-final/tree/solution) with a possible filled out version of the code.

## Conclusion
Overall, it was a fun experience to have a backwards perspective of learning AP CS by creating a lesson for other students and I rather enjoyed getting to explore things like Java tests and hash maps further.
