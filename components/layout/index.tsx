These include, but are not limited to: programming languages such as Go, C++, and TypeScript; the workings of OSes on a software level as well as the hardware counterpart; and finally the inner workings of different software, games, and other media and reverse engineering them. In addition, I run a YouTube channel where I post tech videos. I hope this website will serve as a hub for my many different endeavors and will allow for others to follow along or learn something."
